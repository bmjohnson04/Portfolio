A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/midniteio/pen/pybXOY.

 A bootstrap carousel that uses webms, with a fallback to mp4s, for full screen (or full container, if bounding container not desired to be full screen) background video. This allows for any form of HTML as an overlay.

Importantly, event listeners are setup on carousel actions to allow for fading transitions, but to still play/pause videos based on the active carousel item, so that all videos do not need to play/load while not in view.

Slides can be setup easily with whichever templating engine you please, shown here hardcoded at 4 slides as an example.
